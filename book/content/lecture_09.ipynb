Each truck of type T1 can carry 10 tons of goods and costs ₹5000 per trip, while each truck of type T2 can carry 20 tons and costs ₹8000 per trip. Considering the managerial capacity of the firm (warehouse capacity, staff numbers, etc.), the management committee has imposed an upper limit on truck rental of 20 trucks in total, with a maximum of 12 any individual type of truck. Thus, all things considered, how many T1 and T2 type trucks should the company deploy so as to minimize the total costs?\n",

Note, the standard 78-capacity economy class coach amounts to ₹50,000 in daily operational costs and generates an average revenue of ₹750 per seat. On the other hand, the standard 52-capacity executive class coach amounts to ₹55,000 in daily operational costs and generates an average revenue of ₹2000 per seat. Assuming that a minimum of 16 coaches must be deployed, how many economy and executive coaches should the Southern Railways deploy in the VB so as to maximize the profits while maintaining a 95% service level (satisfying passenger demand on 95% of the days)?\n",

Further, due to congestion, the operational costs of a bus – which include driver, fuel, and maintenance costs, also vary through the day (see table below). Note, to maintain a minimum level of service, the operator is regulated to not reduce service by more than 3 buses between any two consecutive time periods.
