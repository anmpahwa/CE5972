# Lecture 4

Before we begin programming optimisation models, we will first cover some basics of linear algebra in this lecture.

## Linear Algebra

### Vectors

Vectors are an array of numbers arranged either in a column or in a row. Thus, a column vector with $n$ rows has a dimension of $n \times 1$.

  $$
  v_1 = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  9 \\
  1 \\
  5 \\
  4 \\
  6 \\
  7
  \end{bmatrix}_{6 \times 1}
  \quad
  v_2 = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  9 & 1 & 5 & 4 & 6 & 7
  \end{bmatrix}_{1 \times 6}
  $$

### Matrices

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers.

  $$
  \mathbf{M} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  9 & 1 & 5 \\
  4 & 6 & 7
  \end{bmatrix}_{2 \times 3}
  $$

### Operations

- **Addition**
- **Multiplication**

### System of Equations

We will delve deeper into solving systems of equations later in the course.
