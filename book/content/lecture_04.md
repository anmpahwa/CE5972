# Lecture 4

Before we begin programming optimisation models, we will first cover some basics of linear algebra in this lecture.

## Linear Algebra

### Vectors

Vectors are an array of numbers arranged either in a column or in a row. Thus, a column vector with $n$ rows has a dimension of $n \times 1$.

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
\vdots \\
x_n
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Matrices

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers.

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \dots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \dots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \dots & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Operations

- **Addition**
- **Multiplication**

### System of Equations

We will delve deeper into solving systems of equations later in the course.
