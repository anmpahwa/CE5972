# Lecture 4

Before we begin programming optimisation models, we will first cover some basics of linear algebra in this lecture.

## Linear Algebra

### Vectors

Vectors are an array of numbers arranged either in a column or in a row. Thus, a column vector with $n$ rows has a dimension of $n \times 1$, while a row vector with $n$ columns has a dimension of $1 \times n$.

For example,

$$
\mathbf{v} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
9 \\
1 \\
5 \\
4 \\
6 \\
7
\end{bmatrix}_{6 \times 1}
\quad
\mathbf{v} =
\begin{bmatrix}
9 & 1 & 5 & 4 & 6 & 7
\end{bmatrix}_{1 \times 6}
$$

Note, the $i^{th}$ element of vector $v$ is given by $v_i$.

### Matrices

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers with $r$ rows and $c$ columns, thus having a dimension of $r \times c$.

For example,

$$
\mathbf{M} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
9 & 1 & 5 \\
4 & 6 & 7
\end{bmatrix}_{2 \times 3}
$$

Note, the element from $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column of matrix $M$ is given by $m_{ij}$. 

### Operations

- **Addition**
- **Multiplication**

### System of Equations

We will delve deeper into solving systems of equations later in the course.
