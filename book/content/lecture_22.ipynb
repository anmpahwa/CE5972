    "As seen in our 5-node problem, we have 35 constraints. As the problem size increases, the number of constraints grows exponentially, making direct solution approaches computationally expensive. To address this, researchers have developed exact optimization methods such as Branch-and-Bound (B&B) and Branch-and-Price (which combines Column Generation with B&B). These methods decompose the problem into smaller subproblems and iteratively refine solutions to find the global optimum efficiently. However, for large instances, exact methods may still be computationally prohibitive. In such cases, heuristic and metaheuristic approaches, including Nearest Neighbor, Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, and Ant Colony Optimization, provide near-optimal solutions in a reasonable time. In the next module, we will explore some of these heuristic approaches.\n",
