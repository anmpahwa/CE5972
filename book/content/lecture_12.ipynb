    "Consider a textile firm operating in Kochi. This company needs to ship 100 tons of textile goods from Kanchipuram and can rent two types of trucks - T1 and T2. Each truck of type T1 can carry 10 tons of goods and costs ₹5000 per trip, while each truck of type T2 can carry 20 tons and costs ₹8000 per trip. Further, considering the managerial capacity of the firm (warehouse capacity, staff numbers, etc.), the management committee has imposed an upper limit on truck rental of 20 trucks in total, with a maximum of 12 any individual type of truck. Thus, how many T1 and T2 type trucks should the company deploy so as to minimize the total costs?\n",
