    "## Interpreting the Primal and Dual Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The primal problem represents the original optimization perspective, focusing on the objective function through decision variables $(x_i)$. Thus, optimising the primal problem renders primal variable values that optimise the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dual problem, on the other hand, provides a complementary perspective by focusing on the constraints themselves, interpreting them as resources with associated dual variables $(y_i)$. Thus, optimising the dual problem renders dual variable values that indicate how much the objective function would improve if a constraint is relaxed by one unit - Shadow Price. \n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between the primal and dual problems thus reveals deep economic insights: while the primal focuses on decision-making, the dual evaluates the worth of resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a textile firm operating in Kochi. This company needs to ship 100 tons of textile goods from Kanchipuram and can rent two types of trucks - $\\text{T}_1$ and $\\text{T}_2$. Each truck of type $\\text{T}_1$ can carry 10 tons of goods and costs ₹5000 per trip, while each truck of type $\\text{T}_2$ can carry 20 tons and costs ₹8000 per trip. Considering the managerial capacity of the firm (warehouse capacity, staff numbers, etc.), the management committee has imposed an upper limit on truck rental of 20 trucks in total, with a maximum of 12 any individual type of truck. Thus, all things considered, how many $\\text{T}_1$ and $\\text{T}_2$ type trucks should the company deploy so as to minimize the total costs? \n",
