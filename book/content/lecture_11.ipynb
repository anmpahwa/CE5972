    "In lecture 6, we employed graphical solution methods to solve two-variable linear optimisation problems. However, as discussed in lectures 7 and 8, a general $n$-dimensional problem requires more sophisticated computational tools. In the backend of these computational tools resides the Simplex Algorithm. In this lecture we will take a closer look at this algorithm to address general $n$-dimensional linear optimisation problems.\n",
