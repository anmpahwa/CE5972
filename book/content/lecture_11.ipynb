    "In the previous lecture, we developed fundamentals of the Simplex Algorithm. We begin by transforming the $n$-dimensional linear optimisation problem with $m$ techinical constraints into the standardised form rendering a system of $m$ equations with $n+m$ variables including $n$ decision variables and $m$ slack variables. Consequently, we iterate through $(n+m)$ $\\text{C}$ $m = (n+m)! / (n!m!)$ possible combinations of $n$ non-basic variables and $m$ basic variables to find the optimal solution. This results in a huge number of iterations, even for a fairly small problem, as shown below. \n",

    "Consider a public bus operator (government-owned) providing service between Chennai and Tirumala. Owing to the variation of demand through the day, the operator requires a different number of buses during different time periods of the day (see table below). Further, due to congestion, the operational costs of a bus – which include driver, fuel, and maintenance costs, also vary through the day (see table below). Note, to maintain a minimum level of service, the operator is regulated to not reduce service by more than 3 buses between any two consecutive time periods. Thus, how many buses should the operator run during different time periods so as to minimize the costs?\n",

From hereon, the algorithm makes $x_i$ with smallest $c_i$ (for minimisation problem) a basic variable. In particular, the algorithm fixes the value for this $x_i$ to the smallest value such that the resulting combination of basic/non-basic variables is a basic feasible solution.
