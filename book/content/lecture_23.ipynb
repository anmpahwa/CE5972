    "\n",
    "A typical Vehicle Routing Problem is defined on a directed graph $G=(d,C,A)$, where $d$ represents depot node, node set $C$ represents customer nodes, and arc set $A$ represents the set of arcs connecting these nodes. Here, each customer node $c \\in C$ has a demand $q_c$ that must be fulfilled from the depot via delivery fleet $V$, wherein each vehicle $v$ has a capacity $q_v$ and speed $s_v$. Given traversal cost $c_{ij}$ for arc $(i,j) \\in A$, the objective of a Vehicle Routing Problem is to develop least cost routes from the depot node using select vehicles such that every customer node is visited exactly once while satisfying all logistic constraints.\n",

    "The Chennai head post-office needs to deliver packages via the 9 branch post-offices using a fleet of 3 small delivery trucks, each with capacity of 750, 900, and 1000 kgs. Given the demand at each branch post-office and the distances between these post-offices, how should the head post-office deploy its fleet of delivery trucks.\n",

    "For only a 10-node problem, we have a huge number of constraints. As the problem size increases, the number of constraints grows exponentially, making direct solution approaches computationally expensive. To address this, researchers have developed exact optimization methods such as Branch-and-Bound (B&B) and Branch-and-Price (which combines Column Generation with B&B). These methods decompose the problem into smaller subproblems and iteratively refine solutions to find the global optimum efficiently. However, for large instances, exact methods may still be computationally prohibitive. In such cases, heuristic and metaheuristic approaches, including Nearest Neighbor, Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, and Ant Colony Optimization, provide near-optimal solutions in a reasonable time. In the next module, we will explore some of these heuristic approaches.\n",

    "In the above formulation, we assume that a vehicle can arrive early at a customer node, and consequently wait before starting service (soft time-windows). This could be the case with delivery systems for commercial clients or warehouses, where operations are scheduled to align with fixed working hours or batch processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an even more linient variant, the vehicle need not wait, but instead start service upon arrival. This is the case with most e-commerce deliveries, wherein if the package arrives earlier than expected/promised, then it could be left outside the customer's door.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in a more stringent version (hard time-windows), the vehicle must arrive and service, both, within the specified time-window. This could be the case with supply-chains where precise timing is necessary to maintain the integrity of items or to ensure the availability of trained personnel for handling sensitive products.\n",

    "The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) has numerous variants, each addressing specific operational constraints or objectives. The Capacitated VRP focuses on minimizing the total cost of routing vehicles to service a set of customers using a fixed fleet of delivery vehicles, each with a given capacity. Additionally, the VRP with Time Windows (VRPTW) adds the requirement to service customers within specific time intervals. In the VRP with Pickup and Delivery (VRPPD), vehicles must handle both pickups and deliveries with precedence constraints, whereas the Split Delivery VRP (SDVRP) allows dividing customer demands across multiple vehicles for efficiency. The Open VRP (OVRP) relaxes the need for vehicles to return to the depot after completing their routes, and the Multi-Depot VRP (MDVRP) extends the problem to include multiple depots. Beyond these, many other variants of VRP exist to address specific logistic scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these  sophisiticated variants of VRP, we typically deploy metaheuristic algorithms for practical purposes (discussed in the next module).\n",
