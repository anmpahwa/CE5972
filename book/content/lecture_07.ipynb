    "1. **Road Maintenance Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA) is planning to allocate ₹5,00,000 to maintain two major arterial routes, R1 and R2. R1 has a maintenance cost of ₹50,000 per kilometer, while R2 amounts for ₹30,000 per kilometer for road maintenance. To ensure a minimal level of service on both arterial routes, CUMTA must finance upkeep of at least 5 kilometers on both routes. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Formulate an optimisation problem to optimise the total length of roads maintained. (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Clearly explain the objective function, decision variables, as well as technical and domain constraints. (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - State the necessary assumptions. (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Appropiately categorise the optimisation problem. (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Delhi-Chennai High-Speed Rail Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The National High Speed Rail Coroporation (NHRC) plans to operate two types of high-speed bullet trains, T1 and T2, between Delhi and Chennai, cutting down travel time between two cities from 32 hours to less than 12 hours. T1 is an express service stopping at Vijaywada, Nagpur, Bhopal, and Agra on its way from Chennai to Delhi. On the other hand, T2 is an economy service with additional stops at Gudur, Balharshah, and Jhansi. Note, T1 has a capacity of 800 and runs at an operational cost of ₹250 per km, while T2 can serve 1200 passengers with an operational cost of ₹200 per km. Further, the daily passenger demand on the route is uncertain and follows a normal distribution with a mean of 5000 passengers and a standard deviation of 500.\n",

    "3. **Holiday-Special Train Scheduling Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Indian Railways needs to schedule holiday-special trains between Chennai and Hyderabad to cater to the increased demand during the Pongal festival. Specifically, the surge in passenger demand for the three days prior to the festival is 10k, 15k, and 12k passengers, respectively. If the holiday-special trains can serve upto 1500 passengers at an operating cost of ₹150 per km, then,\n",

    "\n",
    "    Amazon plans to operate three types of delivery fleets T1 (diesel van), T2 (electric van), and T3 (motorised two-wheeler) in Chennai. The table below presents key characteristics of these three delivery vehicles - purchase cost, operatonal cost (fuel cost + maintenance cost + driver wage), and capacity. \n",
