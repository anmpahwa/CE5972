    "Consider a textile firm operating in Kochi. This company needs to ship 100 tons of textile goods from Kanchipuram and can rent two types of trucks: T1 and T2. Each truck of type T1 can carry 10 tons of goods and costs ₹5000 per trip, while each truck of type T2 can carry 20 tons and costs ₹8000 per trip. Considering the managerial capacity of the firm (warehouse capacity, staff numbers, etc.), the management committee has imposed an upper limit on truck rental of 20 trucks in total, with a maximum of 12 any individual type of truck. Thus, all things considered, how many T1 and T2 type trucks should the company deploy so as to minimize the total costs?\n",

    "Consider the two routes, R1 and R2, connecting Chennai Central Railway Station to Madras International Meenambakkam Airport. Here, R1 is a major arterial route with a travel time of 30 minutes and capacity of 1000 vehicles per hour. On the other hand, R2 is a collector route with a travel time of 45 minutes and capacity of 750 vehicles per hour. Assuming that Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA) has approporiate traffic control systems to route traffic through either of these routes, how should CUMTA allocate vehicles to each route in order to minimise the total vehicle hours traveled (VHT)?\n",

    "A transportation firm in Chennai aims to manage commuter flow between Anna Nagar and Guindy by deploying two types of bus services, B1 (standard) and B2 (express), with the goal of minimising total costs. Specifically, bus service B1 is a standard 2-hour service priced at ₹50 per ticket with a capacity for 50 passengers, while bus service B2 is an express 1.5-hour service priced at ₹100 per ticket with a capacity for 30 passengers. Note, the purchase cost of the bus for standard service is ₹1,00,000 while that for the express service is ₹1,50,000. On the other hand, the operational costs amount to ₹1500 for the standard and ₹1000 for the express service. Given a planning horizon of 10 years, 330 working days in a year, and a discount rate of 3%, how many buses should the transportation firm deploy in order to minimise the total cost while ensuring a mimum service level with at least 5 standard service buses and a maximum total commuter-hours of 25. \n",

    "Consider a highway management firm that operates and maintains the expressway connecting Chennai with Bangalore. The highway management firm wants to set toll price $p_1$ for private vehicles and $p_2$ for commercial vehicles, to collect toll revenue on this highway. However, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) wants to facilitate sufficient flow between Chennai and Bangalore, ensuring that at least 1000 private and 1500 commercial vehicles each use the expressway during the peak hour. Note, the peak hour expressway traffic for private and commercial vehicles is subject to respective toll prices, and is given by $Q_1(p_1)$ and $Q_2(p_2)$, respectively. Nonetheless, the NHAI also wants to ensure sufficient tax collection, requiring toll price to at least be ₹150.
