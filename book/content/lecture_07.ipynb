    "Consider a textile firm operating in Kochi. This company needs to ship 100 tons of textile goods from Kanchipuram and can rent two types of trucks: T1 and T2. Each truck of type T1 can carry 10 tons of goods and costs ₹5000 per trip, while each truck of type T2 can carry 20 tons and costs ₹8000 per trip. Considering the managerial capacity of the firm (warehouse capacity, staff numbers, etc.), the management committee has imposed an upper limit on truck rental of 20 trucks in total, with a maximum of 12 any individual type of truck. Thus, all things considered, how many T1 and T2 type trucks should the company deploy so as to minimize the total costs?\n",

    "The Southern Railways wants to start a new daily Vande-Bharat (VB) service between Chennai and Rameshwaram. However, the daily passenger demand is stochastic (uncertain) and follows a normal distribution – with a mean of 900 and standard deviation of 100 for the economy class, and a mean of 30 and standard deviation of 10 for the executive class. Note, the standard 78-capacity economy class coach amounts to ₹50,000 in daily operational costs and generates an average revenue of ₹750 per seat. On the other hand, the standard 52-capacity executive class coach amounts to ₹55,000 in daily operational costs and generates an average revenue of ₹2000 per seat. Assuming that a minimum of 16 coaches must be deployed, how many economy and executive coaches should the Southern Railways deploy in the VB so as to maximize the profits while maintaining a 95% service level (satisfying passenger demand on 95% of the days)?\n",

    "Consider a public bus operator (government-owned) providing service between Chennai and Tirumala. Owing to the variation of demand through the day, the operator requires a different number of buses during different time periods of the day (see table below). Further, due to congestion, the operational costs of a bus – which include driver, fuel, and maintenance costs, also vary through the day (see table below). Note, to maintain a minimum level of service, the operator is regulated to not reduce service by more than 3 buses between any two consecutive time periods. Thus, how many buses should the operator run during different time periods so as to minimize the costs?\n",

    "Consider a highway management firm that operates and maintains the expressway connecting Chennai with Bangalore. The highway management firm wants to set toll price $p_1$ for private vehicles and $p_2$ for commercial vehicles, to collect toll revenue on this highway. However, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) wants to facilitate sufficient flow between Chennai and Bangalore, ensuring that at least 1000 private and 1500 commercial vehicles each use the expressway during the peak hour. Note, the peak hour expressway traffic for private and commercial vehicles is subject to respective toll prices, and is given by $Q_1(p_1)$ and $Q_2(p_2)$, respectively. Nonetheless, the NHAI also wants to ensure sufficient tax collection, requiring toll price to at least be ₹150.
