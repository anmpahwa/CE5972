    "    The Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA) is planning to allocate ₹5,00,000 to maintain two major arterial routes - $\\text{R}_1$ and $\\text{R}_2$. Here, $\\text{R}_1$ has a maintenance cost of ₹50,000 per kilometer, while $\\text{R}_2$ amounts for ₹30,000 per kilometer for road maintenance. If CUMTA plans to finance upkeep of at least 5 kilometers on both the arterial routes to ensure a minimal level of service on the two routes, then,\n",

    "\n",
    "    The National High Speed Rail Coroporation (NHRC) plans to operate two types of high-speed bullet trains, $\\text{T}_1$ and $\\text{T}_2$, between Delhi and Chennai, cutting down travel time between two cities from 32 hours to less than 12 hours. Here, $\\text{T}_1$ is an executive service train with a capacity of 800 passengers and an operational cost of ₹250/km, stopping at Vijaywada, Nagpur, Bhopal, and Agra on its way from Chennai to Delhi. On the other hand, $\\text{T}_2$ is an economy service train with a capacity of 1200 passengers and an operational cost of ₹200/km, having additional stops at Gudur, Balharshah, and Jhansi. To ensure a smooth level of service against an uncertain demand that follows a normal distribution with a mean of 5000 passengers and a standard deviation of 500, and yet maintain operational profitability, NHRC plans to run at most 3 trains daily, for both, executive and economy service. For this problem,\n",
