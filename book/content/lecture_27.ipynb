    "Modern transportation systems leverage advanced technologies to enable data-driven decision-making for optimal performance of the transportation systems. Its applications span a diverse range of domains, including resourceful parking space allocation (parking system optimisation), optimal path-planning for autonomous vehicles (vehicle navigation optimisation), coordinated and synchronised transit operations planning (transit timetable and schedule optimisation), responsive management of on-demand transportation services (dial-a-ride problem), efficient delivery route design (vehicle routing problem), and effective traffic management (traffic signal optimisation, traffic assignment problem). These applications underscore the vital role of modern transportation systems in facilitating urban mobility which is characterised by underctainty (dynamic and stochastic information) as well as high-dimensional decision space, thus necessitating use of advanced computational methods.\n",

    "## Parking System Optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "San Francisco DownTown has $n$ unique parking lots, each with a total of $m_i$ number of parking spaces available. How should the parking space be allocated such that each parking lot has an equitable usage?\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "**uncertainty**: parking demand varies based on factors like time of day (dynamic) as well as weather, road closures, and special events (stochastic), making optimal allocation difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "**high-dimensional decision space**: a combinatorial number of potential solutions exist for this problem.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transit TimeTable Optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Chennai Metro Rail (CMRL) plans to redevelop its timetable to better serve its passengers with an efficient service. How should CMRL design daily train timetable such that the total passenger wait time is minimised?\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "**uncertainty**: passenger demand varies due to weather-related factors, special events, etc. (stochastic) as well as by the time of the day, day of the week, month of the year, etc. (dynamic).\n",
    "\n",
    "**high-dimensional decision space**: designing train schedules across multiple routes, each with varying demand creates a vast search space of feasible timetables.  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vehicle Navigation Optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "How should an autonomous vehicle must navigate a congested urban environment to reach its destination such that the total travel time is minimised?\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "**uncertainty**: traffic conditions are affected by weather, accidents, road closures, etc. (stochastic) and vary by the time of the day, day of the week, month of the year, etc. (dynamic).\n",
    "\n",
    "**high-dimensional decision space**: a navigation problem can render a complex tree of solutions, each represeting different route choice at each intersection.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vehicle Routing Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A logistics company in Mumbai must deliver parcels to $n$ locations in a city using $m$ delivery vehicles. If each vehicle has a capacity of $q$ packages and a time window fo $t$ hours to complete the deliveries, how should the vehicles make delivery such that the total distance travel is minimised?\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "**uncertainty**: often customer location and demand is stochastic and may also be dynamic, arrving periodically in the planning horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "**high-dimensional decision space**: there exist at least $n!$ possible solutions to this problem; moreover, practical applications involve a huge number of delivery points with time-dependent operational variables.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Traffic Signal Optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "An intersection in Delhi has $n (n \\le 6)$ incoming roads. What should be the green light interval logic for each direction such that the total intersection throughput is maximised?\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "**uncertainty**: traffic volumes are stochastic (vary due to weather, road closures, sport/concert events, etc.) and dynamic (vary through the time of the day, day of the week, month of the year, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**high-dimensional decision space**: signal timing optimization across multiple phases, directions, and periods can creates a vast number of possible timing configurations; further, real-world signal optimization requires processing large amounts of historical vehicle flows to assess traffic patterns.\n",
    "```\n",

    "To this end, metaheuristic algorithms have emerged as powerful tools to establish adaptive frameworks that can render near-optimal solutions to these complex transportation problems. Metaheuristics are mechanisms that guide solution search through solution landscape exploration (diversification) and exploitation (intensification). They can be broadly categorised as local search heuristics and population-based heuristics. Notably, local search heuristics iteratively refine solution by exploring and exploiting neighbourhoods of a solution to develop high-quality solution. On the other hand, population-based heuristics iteratively refine a population of solutions by leveraging interaction between different solutions to comprehensively explore and exploit the solution landscape, and thus develop high-quality solutions. Together, these metaheuristic procedures offer a flexible yet robust approach to solving complex optimisation problems inherent to modern transportation systems.\n",
