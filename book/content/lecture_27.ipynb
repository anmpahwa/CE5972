    "Until now, we have studied linear optimisation problems in Transportation Engineering, wherein both, the objective function and constraints are a linear function of the decision variables. However, most practical applications encompass non-linear modeling of objective function or constraints, thus necessitating non-linear optimisation. In this final module of this course, we will focus on optimisation techniques to address some of the non-linear optimisation problems in Transportation Engineering.\n",

    "Consider a highway management firm that operates and maintains the expressway connecting Chennai with Bangalore. The highway management firm wants to set toll price $p_1$ for private vehicles and $p_2$ for commercial vehicles, to collect toll revenue on this highway. However, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) wants to facilitate sufficient flow between Chennai and Bangalore, ensuring that at least 1000 private and 1500 commercial vehicles each use the expressway during the peak hour. Note, the peak hour expressway traffic for private and commercial vehicles is subject to respective toll prices, and is given by $Q_1(p_1)$ and $Q_2(p_2)$, respectively. Nonetheless, the NHAI also wants to ensure sufficient tax collection, requiring toll price to at least be â‚¹150. Considering these regulations, what toll prices should the firm set so as to maximize the toll revenue?\n",
