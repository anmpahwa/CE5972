    "A Transportation Problem involves shipping goods from $m$ supply points to $n$ demand points. Here, each supply point has a maximum supply capacity of $s_i \\ \\forall \\ i \\in [1,m]$, and every demand point has a minimum demand requirement of $d_j \\ \\forall \\ i \\in [1,n]$. Further, each unit of goods shipped from a supply point $i$ to a demand point $j$ incurs a cost $c_ij$. Hence, the objective of a Transportation Problem is to minimise the cost of transporting goods from supply to demand points while satisfying for the supply and demand constraints.\n",
