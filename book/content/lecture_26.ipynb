    "1. Sree Krishna Bricks operates two brick manufacturing plants in Medavakkam that cater to five client construction sites across Chennai. The table below presents supply capacities of the plants and demand requirements of the sites (in tonnes). Additionally, it details the cost of transporting a tonne of bricks between each plant and site (in ₹k). Determine the shipping plan for the company that minimises the transportation costs while satisifying the supply and demand constraints.\n",

Vehicle Routing Problem: We have a directed graph $G=(N,A); N=\\{{d} \\cup C\\}$, where d represents the depot node, C represents set of customer nodes, and A represents the set of arcs connecting these nodes. The depot has an associated set of electric delivery vehicles $V$, wherein each vehicle has a capacity $q_v$, range $l_v$, and a traversal cost of $π_o$ per km on arc $(i,j) \\in A$ spanning a length of length $d_{ij}$. Further, each customer node c∈C has a demand $q_c$ that must be fulfilled from the depot nodes via one of its electric delivery vehicles. For the given problem, \n",
