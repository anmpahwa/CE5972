    "1. Sree Krishna Bricks operates two brick manufacturing plants in Medavakkam that cater to five client construction sites across Chennai. The table below presents supply capacities of the plants and demand requirements of the sites (in tonnes). Additionally, it details the cost of transporting a tonne of bricks between each plant and site (in â‚¹k). Determine the shipping plan for the company that minimises the transportation costs while satisifying the supply and demand constraints.\n",

    "2. Location Routing Problem: We have a directed graph  $G=(D,C,A)$, where $D$ represents set of depot nodes, $C$ represents set of customer nodes, and $A$ represents the set of arcs connecting these nodes. Each depot node $d \\in D$ has an associated set of electric delivery vehicles $V_d$, capacity $q_d$, as well as a fixed cost $\\pi_f^d$. Further, each customer node $c \\in C$ has a demand $q_c$ that must be fulfilled from one of the depot nodes via its elecxtric delivery fleet, wherein each vehicle has a fixed cost $\\pi_f^v$, capacity $q_v$, range $l_v$, and a traversal cost of $\\pi_o$ per km on arc $(i,j) \\in A$ spanning a length of $d_{ij}$ kms, the objective of a Location Routing Problem is to develop least cost routes from select distribution facilities using select vehicles such that every customer node is visited exactly once while satisfying all logistic constraints.
