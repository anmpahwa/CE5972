## Origins of Applied Optimisation
Human civilization witnessed a tremendours growth in size and complexity during the Industrial Revolution leading to segmentation of labor and management responsibilities in:

- Public organisations (e.g., national government)
- Private organisations (e.g., tech companies)

**Core Question**: How to allocate the available resources to various operations and activities in a way that is optimal for the organization as a whole?

## Applied Optimisation
A scientific approach to decision-making applied to sectors like:

### 1. Construction

Bechtel: Engineering, Construction & Project Management

**Optimisation**: Given construction activity specifications (timeline, material requirements, and equipment constraints) and labour regulations (working hours and rest time), Bechtel optimised the scheduling of the construction activities for an oil refinery.

**Impact**: By optimising construction scheduling, Bechtel minimised delays and resource using leading to reduction in the overall project time by 18% and saved $10 million in operational costs.

### 2. Financial Planning

JP Morgan: Investment Banking Company, USA

**Optimisation**: Given market uncertainties and client risk preferences, JP Morgan optimized portfolio allocation (stocks, bonds, real estate, and cash).

**Impact**: By optimising financial planning of investment portfolios, JP Morgan improved risk-adjusted returns and reduced portfolio volatility for their clients.

### 3. Manufacturing

Samsung Electronics: RAM Fabrication Unit, South Korea

**Optimisation**: Given machine specifications (production cost, time, and volume) and customer demand characteristics, Samsung RAM fabrication unit optimised RAM inventory levels.

**Impact**: By optimising manufacturing processes, Samsung reduced its fulfilment/service time from 80 days to 30 days, thus increasing its annual sales revenue by $200 million.

### 4. Health Care

Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), USA

**Optimisation**: Given tumour cell characteristics, MSKCC optimized radiotherapy application to maximize its effectiveness while minimizing damage to healthy tissue.

**Impact**: By optimising health care treatment, MSKCC saved $500 million annually from reduced pre-treatment planning and post-treatment procedures.

### 5. Human Resource

Taco Bell: Mexican Fast-Food Chain, USA

**Optimising Human Resources**: Given customer demand characteristics and labour regulations (working hours and rest time), Taco Bell optimised number of employees for each shift.

**Impact**: By optimising human resource management, Taco Bell saved $13 million annually in labor costs.

### 6. Telecommunications

AT&T: Telecommunications Service, USA

**Optimisation**: Given customer call characteristics, AT&T developed a call processing simulator to optimise call handling (immediate answering or busy signal) and work-load distribution across call-agents.

**Impact**: By optimising telecommunications services, AT&T secured over $750 million in annual profit for its business customers and earned the prestigious 1993 Franz Edelman Award for OR excellence.

### 7. Transportation

Sears: Multi-Line Retailer, USA

**Optimisation**: Given customer demand specifications and vehicle fleet characteristics, Sears optimised home-delivery service including customers assigned to each vehicle-route and the order in which the customers were served on each vehicle-route.

**Impact**: By optimising transportation services, Sears saved over $42 million in annual savings with improved service to customers.
