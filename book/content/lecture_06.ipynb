    "Consider the two routes, $\\text{R}_1$ and $\\text{R}_2$, connecting Chennai Central Railway Station to Madras International Meenambakkam Airport. Here, $\\text{R}_1$ is a major arterial route with a travel time of 30 minutes and capacity of 1000 vehicles per hour. On the other hand, $\\text{R}_2$ is a collector route with a travel time of 45 minutes and capacity of 750 vehicles per hour. Assuming that Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA) has approporiate traffic control systems to route traffic through either of these routes, how should CUMTA allocate peak traffic of 1200 vehicles per hour to each route in order to minimise the total vehicle hours traveled (VHT)?\n",

    "A transportation firm in Chennai aims to manage commuter flow between Anna Nagar and Guindy by deploying two types of bus services, $\\text{B}_1$ (standard) and $\\text{B}_2$ (express), with the goal of minimising total costs. Specifically, bus service $\\text{B}_1$ is a standard 2-hour service priced at ₹50 per ticket with a capacity for 50 passengers, while bus service $\\text{B}_2$ is an express 1.5-hour service priced at ₹100 per ticket with a capacity for 30 passengers. Note, the purchase cost of the bus for standard service is ₹25,00,000 while that for the express service is ₹30,00,000. On the other hand, the operational costs amount to ₹1500 for the standard and ₹1000 for the express service. Given a planning horizon of 10 years, 330 working days in a year, and a discount rate of 3%, how many buses should the transportation firm deploy in order to minimise the total cost while ensuring a mimum service level with at least 5 standard service buses and a maximum total commuter-hours of 25. Assume ticket prices and operational costs to grow at the discount rate.\n",
