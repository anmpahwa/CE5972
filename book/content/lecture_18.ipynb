    "For a network modeled as a directed graph $G=(N,A)$, with $N$ and $A$ representing the set of nodes and arcs, respectively, the objective of a Minimum Spanning Tree is to find a subset of arcs (tree) that connects all nodes with a minimum total cost, given that each arc $(i,j) \\in A$ has a cost $c_{ij}$.\n",
