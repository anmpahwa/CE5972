    "For a network modeled as a directed graph $G=(N,A)$, with $N$ and $A$ representing the set of nodes and edges, respectively, the objective of a Maximum Flow Problem is to find the maximum amount of flow that can be transported this network from a source node $r$ to a sink node $s$, given that each edge $(i,j) \\in A$ has a capacity $q_{ij}$.\n",
