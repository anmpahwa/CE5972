    "# Lecture 4: Linear Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The first module of this course focuses on developing objective function, defining decision variables, and formulating constraints for linear programming problems. We will explore associated solution methods such as the graphical approach and the simplex algorithm, along with decision-making principles for interpreting results, conducting sensitivity analysis, and understanding duality.\n",

    "## Definition \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Programming involves a linear objective function and a set of linear constraints, i.e., the objective function and constraints are expressed as linear combination of decision variables. Thus, a general linear optimisation problem can be expressed as,\n",

    "\\min_{\\mathbf{x}} \\ f(\\mathbf{x}) = c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + ... + c_mx_m\n",

    "Here, $f(\\mathbf{x})$ is the objective function, $x_i$ is a decision variable, $a_{i1}x_1 + a_{i2}x_2 + ... + a_{im}x_m \\geq/= b_i$ is a technological constraint, and $x_i \\geq 0$ is a domain constriant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Proportionality - The contribution of each decision variable to the objective function and constraints is poroportional to the value of the variable.\n",
    "2. Additivity - The contribution of each decision variable to the objective function and constraints is independent of the values of other decision variables.\n",
    "3. Divisibility - The decision variables are allowed to take fractional values.\n",
    "4. Certainty - All the parameters are known with certainty.\n",

    "Consider a textile firm operating in Kochi. This company needs to ship 100 tons of textile goods from Kanchipuram and can rent two types of trucks: T1 and T2. Each truck of type T1 can carry 10 tons of goods and costs ₹5000 per trip, while each truck of type T2 can carry 20 tons and costs ₹8000 per trip. Considering the managerial capacity of the firm (warehouse capacity, staff numbers, etc.), the management committee has imposed an upper limit on truck rental of 20 trucks in total, with a maximum of 12 any individual type of truck. Thus, all things considered, how many T1 and T2 type trucks should the company deploy so as to minimize the total costs?\n",

    "Notice, in all the example problems we are given a defined problem (step 1 of the five step process) with relevant data (step 2) and thus we formulate the problem (step 3). In the next few lectures, we shall develop and employ appropriate optimisation techniques (step 4) before moving onwards to inferring and implementing the results (step 5)."
