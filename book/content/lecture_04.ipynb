    "# Lecture 4: Linear Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The first module of this course focuses on developing objective function, defining decision variables, and formulating constraints for linear programming problems. We will explore associated solution methods such as the graphical approach and the simplex algorithm, along with decision-making principles for interpreting results, conducting sensitivity analysis, and understanding duality.\n",

    "\n",
    "  Linear Programming involves a linear objective function and a set of linear constraints, i.e., the objective function and constraints are expressed as linear combination of decision variables.\n",

    "  For instance, the following problem is a linear optimisation problem,\n",

Thus, the set of values of the decision variables that satisfy these constraints constitute the feasible region; hence, any value in this region is referred to as a feasible value; and therefore, the value in this feasible region that optimises the objective function is called the optimal solution.\n",

    "  ## Assumptions\n",
    "  1. Proportionality - The contribution of each decision variable to the objective function and constraints is poroportional to the value of the variable.\n",
    "  2. Additivity - The contribution of each decision variable to the objective function and constraints is independent of the values of other decision variables.\n",
    "  3. Divisibility - The decision variables are allowed to take fractional values.\n",
    "  4. Certainty - All the parameters are known with certainty."
