    "In lecture 6, we employed graphical solution methods to solve two-variable linear optimisation problems. However, as discussed in lectures 7 and 8, a general $n$-dimensional problem requires more sophisticated computational tools. In the backend of these computational tools resides the Simplex Algorithm. In this lecture we will take a closer look at this algorithm to address general $n$-dimensional linear optimisation problems.\n",

Specifically, it is possible to have a linear optimisation problem with $n$ decision variables and $m$ constraints, rendering a rectangular matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ with $m$ rows and $n$ columns, where $n \\ne m$. \n",

    "Now then, having converted the linear optimisation problem into a system of $m$ equations equations with $n + m$ variables ($n$ decision and $m$ slack variables), we will now set $n$ variables to 0, allowing us to uniquely compute the values for the remaining $(n + m) - n = m$ variables. Note, the former set of variables are referred to as the non-basic variables (NBV), while the latter set of variables are referred to as the basic variables (BV). If the resulting set of values of basic variables satisfy $\\mathbf{x,s} \\geq 0$, then the set of basic and non-basic variable values are said to form a basic feasible solution (BFS).\n",
