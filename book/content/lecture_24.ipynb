    "A typical Location Routing Problem is defined on a directed graph $G=(D,C,A)$, where $D$ represents set of depot nodes, node set $C$ represents customer nodes, and arc set $A$ represents the set of arcs connecting these nodes. Each depot node $d \\in D$ has an associated set of delivery vehicles $V_d$, capacity $q_d$, as well as a fixed cost $\\pi_f^d$ . Further, each customer node $c \\in C$ has a demand $q_c$ that must be fulfilled from one of the depot nodes via its delivery fleet, wherein each vehicle has a fixed cost $\\pi_f^v$, capacity $q_v$ and speed $s_v$. Given a traversal cost of $\\pi_o d_{ij}$ on arc $(i,j) \\in A$, the objective of a Location Routing Problem is to develop least cost routes from select distribution facilities using select vehicles such that every customer node is visited exactly once while satisfying all logistic constraints.\n",

    "Just like the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), the Location Routing Problem (LRP) has numerous variants, each addressing specific constraints or objectives. Specifically, in addition to all the variants discussed for VRP, LRP variants could include multiple facilities or even multiple echelons (hierarchy of facilities). To address scuh sophisiticated variants of LRP, we typically deploy metaheuristic algorithms for practical purposes (discussed in the next module).\n",

    "### Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "The conventional approach to modelling routing problems involves use of the discrete formulation method rendering a representative mathematical model. This approach, while detailed, necessitates the use of advanced solution techniques due to inherent model complexities. Such an intensive approach is justified for operational planning, wherein decision-makers have exact information and thus require a precise plan to execute specific last-mile distribution tasks. However, for strategic planning, wherein the primary goal is to develop broad plan based on representative rather than exact information, the level of precision offered by the conventional approach becomes redundant. To this end, continuous approximation (CA) method offers a practical alternative with use of continuous density functions that estimate parameters approximately. In particular, by abstracting discrete information into continuous function forms, this approach strikes a balance between estimation accuracy and computational effort, facilitating agile and efficient decision-making. To do so, CA-based routing frameworks assume a simplified distribution environment. Specifically, these frameworks consider a logistic operator catering to customers having uniformly dispersed random locations and fixed unitary demand from a distribution facility located sufficiently far from the service region, rendering total delivery tour length of \n",

    "Amazon plans to serve 12000 customers in a service region of size 369.34 $\\text{km}^2$ from the following potential distribution facilities (see Table below) using a fleet of diesel vans with a purchase cost of ₹6L, operational cost of ₹35 per km, and a capacity of 200 customers, each, over a period of 7 years, each with 330 working days. Given that a delivery vehicle can do at most 3 tours per day, owing to temporal constraints (customer time-windows, driver work hours, distribution facility operational hours, etc.), which facility should Amazon choose to operate from?\n",
