    "## General Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical Location Routing Problem is defined on a directed graph $G=(D,C,A)$, where $D$ represents set of depot nodes, node set $C$ represents customer nodes, and arc set $A$ represents the set of arcs connecting these nodes. Each depot node $d \\in D$ has an associated set of delivery vehicles $V_d$, capacity $q_d$, as well as a fixed cost $c_d$ . Further, each customer node $c \\in C$ has a demand $q_c$ that must be fulfilled from one of the depot nodes via its delivery fleet, wherein each vehicle has a capacity $q_v$ and speed $s_v$. Given traversal cost $c_{ij}$ for arc $(i,j) \\in A$, the objective of a Location Routing Problem is to develop least cost routes from select distribution facilities using select vehicles such that every customer node is visited exactly once while satisfying all logistic constraints.\n",

    "Just like the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), the Location Routing Problem (LRP) has numerous variants, each addressing specific constraints or objectives. Specifically, in addition to all the variants discussed for VRP, LRP variants could include multiple facilities or even multiple echelons (hierarchy of facilities). To address scuh sophisiticated variants of LRP, we typically deploy metaheuristic algorithms for practical purposes (discussed in the next module).\n",
