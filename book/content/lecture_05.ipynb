    "Consider a textile firm operating in Kochi. This company needs to ship 100 tons of textile goods from Kanchipuram and can rent two types of trucks - $\\text{T}_1$ and $\\text{T}_2$. Each truck of type $\\text{T}_1$ can carry 10 tons of goods and costs ₹5000 per trip, while each truck of type $\\text{T}_2$ can carry 20 tons and costs ₹8000 per trip. Thus, how many $\\text{T}_1$ and $\\text{T}_2$ type trucks should the company deploy so as to minimize the total costs?\n",

Notice, constraints $10x_1 + 20x_2 \\geq 100$ and $x_1 \\geq 0$ define the solution, and thus are binding, while none of the other constraints shape the solution, and hence are non-binding. To be precise, a binding constraint is one that directly affects the optimal solution. At the optimal point, the constraint equation is exactly satisfied (meaning it \"binds\" or restricts the solution to that specific boundary). If this constraint were removed or relaxed, the optimal solution would change. On the other hand, a non-binding constraint is one that does not limit or affect the optimal solution. If this constraint were removed, the optimal solution would remain the same.\n",
