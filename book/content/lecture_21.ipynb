    "For a network modeled as a directed graph $G=(N,A)$, with $N$ and $A$ representing the set of nodes and arcs, respectively, the objective of a Least-Cost Problem is to find the path from an origin node $r$ to a destination node $s$ that renders least possible cost, given that each arc $(i,j) \\in A$ has a cost $c_{ij}$.\n",
