    "The Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search (ALNS) algorithm begins by setting the current solution – $s$, and the best solution – $s^*$, to the initial solution – $s_o$. In addition, it also initialises a long-term memory of previously visited solutions in the form of a hash list to prevent redundant search. Further, given a set of removal operators – $o_r$, and insertion operators – $o_i$, the algorithm assigns unit weight to each operator, thus ensuring unbiased search at the outset. Within this adaptive large neighbourhood search procedure, the algorithm also runs a simulated annealing mechanism to enable the algorithm to comprehensively explore the solution landscape. In the ALNS implementation here, the simulated annealing mechanism begins search with a temperature that allows the algorithm to accept a solution up to $\\overline{\\omega}$ times worse than the initial solution with a probability $\\overline{\\tau}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hereafter, the ALNS algorithm runs $j$ segments, each comprising of $n$ iterations. A segment begins with an update of operator probabilities based on the recent updates to operator weights, as well as a reset of operator counts and scores to 0. Thereafter, within each iteration of the segment, the ALNS algorithm randomly selects a removal and an insertion operator based on operator selection probabilities, and subsequently, updates their counts. It then deploys the removal and insertion operator on the current solution, thus destroying and rebuilding the solution to generate a new solution. Note, the size of these operations is stochastic and contingent on thresholds – $\\underline{\\mu}$,$\\overline{\\mu}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the objective function evaluations of the solutions – $f$; If the resulting new solution is better than the best solution, then the ALNS algorithm updates the current and the best solution, and subsequently, rewards the operators with a score of $\\sigma_1$. However, if the new solution in only better than the current solution, then the algorithm updates only the current solution. Further, the operators receive a relatively lower score of $\\sigma_2$, yet only if the new solution is novel. Nonetheless, if the new solution is worse than the current solution, then the ALNS algorithm accepts it as the current solution with a small probability, determined by the Boltzmann function – $p=\\text{exp}⁡((f(s)-f(s' ))/T_k)$. For this update, the operators receive an even lower score of $\\sigma_3$, but yet again, only if the new solution is novel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, at the end of each iteration, the ALNS algorithm stores the current solution into the hash list and updates the search temperature based on the cooling schedule. In the implementation here, the search cools down at an exponential rate dictated by cooling factor - $\\varphi$, nonetheless, the algorithm always maintains a minimum temperature that enables the algorithm to accept a solution up to $\\underline{\\omega}$ times worse than the initial solution with a probability $\\underline{\\tau}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "After completing $k$ such segments, the algorithm resets current solution to the best solution, thus reinforcing the focus on high-quality solutions. At the end of each segment, the ALNS algorithm updates operator weights based on operator performance, i.e., operator scores normalised by operator counts. In particular, the algorithm reacts to the operator performance in the current segment through a reaction factor – $\\rho$, while accounting for operator performance in previous segments through a dissipation factor – $(1-\\rho)$. Further, before initiating the next segment, the algorithm refines the current solution through local search operators – $o_l$, applied iteratively, each for $m$ iterations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, upon completing j×n iterations, the algorithm returns the best solution.\n",
