    "1. **Road Maintenance Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA) is planning to allocate ₹5,00,000 to maintain two major arterial routes - R1 and R2. Here, R1 has a maintenance cost of ₹50,000 per kilometer, while R2 amounts for ₹30,000 per kilometer for road maintenance. Further, CUMTA plans to finance upkeep of at least 5 kilometers on both the arterial routes to ensure a minimal level of service on the two routes. Based on the formulation developed in the previous assignment, develop figures showcasing,\n",

    "2. **Holiday-Special Train Scheduling Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Indian Railways needs to schedule holiday-special trains between Chennai and Hyderabad to cater to the increased demand during the Pongal festival. Specifically, the surge in passenger demand for the three days prior to the festival is 10k, 15k, and 12k passengers, respectively. Further, the holiday-special trains can serve upto 1500 passengers at an operating cost of ₹150 per km. Use the formulation developed in the previous assignment and answer the following questions.\n",

    "3. **Amazon Last-Mile Delivery Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Amazon plans to operate three types of delivery fleets T1 (diesel van), T2 (electric van), and T3 (motorbikes) in Chennai. The table below presents key characteristics of these three delivery vehicles - purchase cost, operatonal cost (fuel cost + maintenance cost + driver wage), and capacity. \n",

    "      | Diesel Van            | 6,00,000                 | ₹7 + ₹3 + ₹25 = ₹35         | 200                            |\n",
    "      | Electric Van          | 9,00,000                 | ₹2 + ₹1 + ₹25 = ₹28         | 150                            |\n",
    "      | Motorbikes            | 1,50,000                 | ₹3 + ₹1 + ₹25 = ₹29         | 20                             |\n",

    "    - Find the optimal number of diesel vans, electric vans, and motorbikes that Amazon should purchase to minimise the total distribution cost. Report the resulting optimal fixed, operational, and total cost in ₹ per customer. (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Explore the impact of removing fleet size constraint for diesel and electric vans. Comment on the impact of removing a binding constraint. (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Considering the previous result, how does the outcome change if the Ministry of Heavy Industry decides to incentivise purchase of electric vans with a subsidy of ₹2L. Comment on the fixed cost vs. operational cost tradeoffs between diesel and electric vans. (2)\n"
