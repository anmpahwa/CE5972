    "1. **Road Maintenance Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA) is planning to allocate ₹5,00,000 to maintain two major arterial routes - $\\text{R}_1$ and $\\text{R}_2$. Here, $\\text{R}_1$ has a maintenance cost of ₹50,000 per kilometer, while $\\text{R}_2$ amounts for ₹30,000 per kilometer for road maintenance. If CUMTA plans to finance upkeep of at least 5 kilometers on both the arterial routes to ensure a minimal level of service on the two routes, then,\n",

    "    - Formulate a mathematical model optimising the total length of roads maintained. (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Clearly explain the objective function, decision variables, as well as technical and domain constraints. (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - State the necessary assumptions. (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Appropiately categorise the optimisation problem. (1)\n",

    "2. **Delhi-Chennai High-Speed Rail Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The National High Speed Rail Coroporation (NHRC) plans to operate two types of high-speed bullet trains, $\\text{T}_1$ and $\\text{T}_2$, between Delhi and Chennai, cutting down travel time between two cities from 32 hours to less than 12 hours. Here, $\\text{T}_1$ is an express service stopping at Vijaywada, Nagpur, Bhopal, and Agra on its way from Chennai to Delhi. On the other hand, $\\text{T}_2$ is an economy service with additional stops at Gudur, Balharshah, and Jhansi. Note, $\\text{T}_1$ has a capacity of 800 and runs at an operational cost of ₹250 per km, while $\\text{T}_2$ can serve 1200 passengers with an operational cost of ₹200 per km. If the daily passenger demand on the route is uncertain and follows a normal distribution with a mean of 5000 passengers and a standard deviation of 500, then,\n",

    "3. **Holiday-Special Train Scheduling Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The operations team of the Southern Indian Railways wants to schedule holiday-special trains, each with a capacity of 1500 passengers, between Chennai and Hyderabad to cater to the increased passenger demand during the Pongal festival. The surge in passenger demand for the three days prior to the festival is expected to be 10k, 15k, and 12k passengers, respectively. If the operational cost of a holiday-special train is ₹150/km, then,\n",

    "\n",
    "    Amazon plans to operate three types of delivery fleets $\\text{T}_1$ (diesel van), $\\text{T}_2$ (electric van), and T3 (motorbike) in Chennai. The table below presents key characteristics of these three delivery vehicles - purchase cost, operatonal cost (fuel cost + maintenance cost + driver wage), and capacity. \n",

    "      | Diesel Van            | 6,00,000                 | ₹7 + ₹3 + ₹25 = ₹35         | 200                            |\n",
    "      | Electric Van          | 9,00,000                 | ₹2 + ₹1 + ₹25 = ₹28         | 150                            |\n",

    "    - Formulate the daily amoritsed fixed cost assuming a planning horizon of 7 years with 330 working days, and a discount rate of 3%. (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Formulate the operational cost if the length of one delivery tour is given by $l_i = 2 \\rho + k c_i / \\sqrt \\delta$, where $\\rho = 25$ is the long-haul distance, $k = 0.57$ is last-mile constant, and $\\delta = 25$ is customer density. (3)\n",

    "    - Formulate the constraints assuming that Amazon a) needs to serve a total of 12000 customers b) must purchase at least 5 diesel and 10 electric vans, and c) can have a delivery vehicle perform a maximum of 3 delivery tours only. (3)"
