    "1. **Road Maintenance Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA) is planning to allocate ₹5,00,000 to maintain two major arterial routes - $\\text{R}_1$ and $\\text{R}_2$. Here, $\\text{R}_1$ has a maintenance cost of ₹50,000 per kilometer, while $\\text{R}_2$ amounts for ₹30,000 per kilometer for road maintenance. If CUMTA plans to finance upkeep of at least 5 kilometers on both the arterial routes to ensure a minimal level of service on the two routes, then,\n",

    "\n",
    "    The operations team of the Southern Indian Railways wants to schedule holiday-special trains between Chennai and Hyderabad to cater to the increased passenger demand during the Pongal festival. The surge in passenger demand for the three days prior to the festival is expected to be 10k, 15k, and 12k passengers, respectively. If a holiday-special train can cater to a maximum of 1500 passengers at an  operational cost of ₹150/km, then,\n",

    "\n",
    "    Amazon plans to operate three types of delivery fleets $\\text{T}_1$ (diesel van), $\\text{T}_2$ (electric van), and T3 (motorbike) in Chennai. The table below presents key characteristics of these three delivery vehicles - purchase cost, operatonal cost (fuel cost + maintenance cost + driver wage), and capacity. \n",
